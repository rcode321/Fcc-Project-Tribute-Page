            <p>Chester Charles Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona. His mother was a nurse, while
              his father was a police detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases. Bennington took an interest in
              music at a young age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations,
              and dreamed of becoming a member of Stone Temple Pilots, which he later achieved when he became their lead
              singer.</p>

              <span id="early-acts">EARLY ACTS</span>
              <p>Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends? They released an
                eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a new band, Grey
                Daze, a post-grunge band from Phoenix, Arizona. The band recorded three albums: Demo in 1993, Wake/Me in
                1994, and ...no sun today in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998, but struggled to find another band

                <img id="linkin-park-img" src="./img/pic12.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Bennington was frustrated and almost ready to quit his musical career altogether when Jeff Blue, the
                  vice president of artists and repertoire at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with
                  the future members of Linkin Park. Bennington quit his day job at a digital services firm and took his
                  family to California, where he had a successful audition with Linkin Park, who were then called Xero.
                  He managed to record the song for his audition in a day, missing his own birthday celebration in the
                  process. Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together,
                  but failed to find a record deal. After facing numerous rejections, Blue, now a vice president of
                  artists and repertoire at Warner Bros., intervened again to help the band sign with Warner Bros.
                  Records.</p>

                  <p>Bennington had a child, Jaime (born May 12, 1996), from his relationship with Elka Brand. In 2006,
                    he adopted Brand's other son, Isaiah (born November 8, 1997). He married his first wife, Samantha
                    Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996.They had one child together, Draven Sebastian (born April 19, 2002).
                    Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park, and
                    they divorced in 2005. In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, a former Playboy model with whom he
                    had three children: Tyler Lee Bennington (born March 16, 2006) and twins Lilly and Lila (born
                    November 6, 2011).</p>
